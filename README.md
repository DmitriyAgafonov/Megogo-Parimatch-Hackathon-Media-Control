# Megogo-Parimatch-Hackathon-Media-Control
Voice assistant app for managing media content. Application as developed during Megogo Parimatch Hackathon

**Issue:** Users may experience inconvenience when interacting with media content.

**Relevance:** according to statistics, more and more people use voice assistants.

As a result, I came to the conclusion that a good **solution** would be a voice assistant for controlling the media player

## App schema

## How it works
1) Ð•he microphone works in streaming mode, waiting for a keyword followed by the main command.
2) Sound filters applied. We used libraries for working with signals, implemented filters based on the Fourier transform, spectral analysis.
3) Voice2text transformation and embedding (translating the text into multidimensional vectors).
4) The user has the ability to give a command that is close in meaning, and not pre-set thanks to the BERT model.
5) Calculating semantic similarity by cosine distance allows to capture the meaning of user`s command.
6) After passing the action to the player, the program waits for the keyword again.

Business part was calculated approximately. Key metrics were established and substantiated.
